# VanHack Code Challenge

## React Native Code Challenge

This is a code challenge received from VanHack, in which I had to create:

1. A Job listing page with a scroll.
2. A Job details page.
3. Be able to apply for a job.
4. Be able to record a video before applying it. Resources: API -
   https://api-interview.vanhack.com/v1/job?skip=0&maxResult=50

- You will need to make an API call to retrieve the jobs.
- Create components as you feel are best suited for your solution. - You don't
  need to handle either post data or authentication

## How to run

Open the terminal inside the project folder, cloned to your machine. Then run:

```Shell
yarn && yarn start
```

Enjoy it!
